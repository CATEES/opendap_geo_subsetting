### About

A notebook demonstrating how to subset a remote OPeNDAP dataset by geographical area.

### For Developers

You must have the `conda` tool available on your path, either from an anaconda or miniconda installation. Run `./develop.sh` to create a development environment and launch Jupyter in your browser (ctrl-c to end the Jupyter session).

Keep `environment.yml` (for deployment conda environments) and `develop.yml` (for local development environments) in sync as necessary. You may need extra packages (e.g. `jupyter`) available for development.

You may want to clean notebooks with _Cell_ > _All Output_ > _Clear_ before committing updates.
